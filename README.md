# How to use this HelloWorld In-meeting app

> Important: Please be advised that access tokens are stored in sessionStorage for you by default. This can make it possible for malicious code in your app (or code pasted into a console on your page) to access APIs at the same privilege level as your client application. Please ensure you only request the minimum necessary scopes from your client application, and perform any sensitive operations from server side code that your client has to authenticate with.

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context. Please be advised that mgt-teamsfx-provider library in this app is currently in preview stage, please expect breaking changes in the future release.
